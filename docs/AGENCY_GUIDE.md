# Agency Guide

This guide helps partner agencies effectively use Path2Better to support their clients.

## Getting Started

### Access Sanity Studio

1. Get admin credentials from your Path2Better administrator
2. Visit: `https://your-project-id.sanity.studio`
3. Log in with provided credentials

### Understanding the Platform

Path2Better connects three groups:
- **Donors**: Community members who want to help
- **Participants**: People you're supporting on their journey
- **Agencies**: You - providing verification and support

Your role is to create campaigns, verify information, and track progress.

## Creating a Campaign

### Step 1: Prepare Information

Before creating a campaign, gather:
- ✅ Participant consent (signed release form)
- ✅ Anonymous profile information (first name, age)
- ✅ Their story (in their words, if possible)
- ✅ Specific, measurable goals
- ✅ Detailed budget breakdown
- ✅ Profile photo (optional, with consent)

### Step 2: Write the Story

**Best practices:**
- Write in third person
- Be specific but respectful of privacy
- Focus on the path forward, not just challenges
- Keep to 200-300 words
- Have participant review and approve

**Good example:**
> "Sarah is a 28-year-old single mother working to secure stable housing after leaving a difficult situation. She's currently staying at YES Shelter while saving for a rental deposit. Sarah has a job offer at a local café starting next month, but needs first and last month's rent to move into an apartment near her children's school. With this support, Sarah will have a stable home base to rebuild her life and provide consistency for her family."

**Avoid:**
- Overly detailed trauma descriptions
- Full names or identifying information
- Vague or uncertain goals
- Guilt-inducing language

### Step 3: Set Clear Goals

Goals should be:
- **Specific**: "Secure 2-bedroom apartment" not "find housing"
- **Achievable**: Realistic timeframe and amount
- **Measurable**: Can be verified as complete

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Complete forklift operator certification at Durham College"
- ✅ "Secure first and last month rent for apartment"
- ✅ "Obtain professional attire and interview training"
- ❌ "Get a job" (too vague)
- ❌ "Buy a car" (likely too expensive/complex for platform)

### Step 4: Create Budget Breakdown

List specific line items with costs:

```
First month rent: $1,200
Last month rent: $1,200
Moving truck rental: $150
Basic furniture (bed, table): $300
Kitchen essentials: $150
---
Total: $3,000
```

**Tips:**
- Get actual quotes when possible
- Round up slightly for contingency
- Be detailed enough to show transparency
- Group very small items together

### Step 5: Add to Sanity

1. Click "Create" → "Campaign"
2. Fill in all required fields:
   - First Name (anonymous - just first name)
   - Age
   - Story (paste prepared text)
   - Goals (add each as separate item)
   - Budget Breakdown (item + amount for each)
   - Funding Goal (total from budget)
   - Status (set to "Active")
   - Agency (your organization name)
   - Slug (auto-generated from first name)
3. Upload profile photo (if you have one with consent)
4. Review everything carefully
5. Click "Publish"

## Managing Active Campaigns

### Posting Updates

**When to post:**
- Every 3 months minimum
- When major milestones are reached
- When goals are achieved
- When circumstances change

**What to include:**
- Progress made since last update
- Funds used and remaining
- Next steps
- Challenges faced (optional)
- Encouragement/gratitude to donors

**Example update:**
> "Sarah signed her lease on March 15th and moved into her new apartment near her children's school. The donation covered first and last month's rent plus moving costs. She started her job at the café and is building stability for her family. Thank you to everyone who made this possible."

### Updating Amount Raised

When donations come in:
1. Open the campaign in Sanity
2. Update "Amount Raised" field
3. Save changes

(Future version will auto-sync with Stripe)

### Changing Campaign Status

**Active → Funded:**
- When funding goal is reached
- Funds don't need to be fully spent yet
- Signals that you're no longer accepting donations

**Funded → Graduated:**
- When participant successfully completes their journey
- All goals achieved or participant is in stable situation
- Write final update celebrating success

## Best Practices

### Participant Privacy

✅ **Do:**
- Use first name only
- Get written consent before creating campaign
- Share stories participant is comfortable with
- Let them review campaign before publishing
- Respect withdrawal requests

❌ **Don't:**
- Share full names
- Include identifying details (workplace, school names, addresses)
- Share photos without explicit consent
- Reveal sensitive health/legal information
- Continue campaign if participant withdraws consent

### Setting Realistic Goals

- Start with smaller, achievable campaigns
- $500 - $3,000 is typical range
- Consider your community's giving capacity
- Focus on one-time needs, not ongoing support
- Have backup plans if funding isn't reached

### Financial Management

- Set up dedicated account for campaign funds
- Track all expenditures with receipts
- Use funds only as specified in budget
- Document any changes/adjustments
- Be prepared for audit (good practice)

### Communication with Donors

Remember:
- Donors can't contact participants directly
- No personal information is shared
- Updates are public and visible to all
- Be professional and appreciative
- Respond to questions via platform admin

## Handling Common Situations

### Campaign Not Reaching Goal

Options:
1. Extend timeline - be patient, share more widely
2. Reduce goal if appropriate
3. Find supplementary funding sources
4. Revise budget with participant
5. Mark as closed and try different approach

### Participant Circumstances Change

If participant:
- No longer needs the funds → Mark as graduated, explain in update
- Needs more than goal → Create second campaign later
- Withdraws consent → Mark as graduated, remove from public site
- Can't be reached → Pause updates, try to reconnect

### Donor Questions

Common questions:
- "Can I donate directly to participant?" → No, all through platform
- "How do I know funds are used properly?" → Agency manages and verifies
- "Can I get a tax receipt?" → [Depends on your nonprofit status]
- "Can I sponsor multiple campaigns?" → Yes, absolutely

## Success Metrics

Track and celebrate:
- Number of campaigns created
- Total funds raised
- Campaigns funded
- Successful graduations
- Average time to funding
- Participant outcomes

Share successes:
- In agency reports
- With board/funders
- On social media (with consent)
